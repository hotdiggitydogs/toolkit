# toolkit
Collection of wrappers and functions for R.

## Installation
The preferred method for installing would be via the "devtools" package developed by Hadley Wickham.

```
# If devtools is not installed, install it
install.packages('devtools')

# Load library and run install_github
library(devtools)
install_github('sean-cho/toolkit')
```
